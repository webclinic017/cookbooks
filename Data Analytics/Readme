Strategic Objectives - What & How?

* What key ressources do we acquire?
  * Data
    * Description
    * Sample size

What are the steps to solve the problem
1. Collecting

2. Importing
- Import the data
- Describe the Data
- Describe the columns

3. Massaging - Tidy the data
- Remove NAS
- Replace Special Characters
- Rename columns
- Create Dummy Variables

Goal:
- Each variable in its own columns
- Each observation in its own row

4. Descriptive
## Summary Statistics

Cheatsheet:
- Dplyr

## Checklist Numerical variables
 Proof of Normality:
- Inspect Histogram and normal quantile plot
- Describe the distribution
- Uniform | Normal | Exponential
- Inspect Values of Skewness & Kurtosis

## Checklist Categorical variables
- Association between categories

## Plots
* Distribution
  * Stats
  * Boxplot
  * Outlier


## Categorical variables
- Frequency Count
- Test for association


5. Predictive

Sampling
- Simple Random Sample (SRS)
- Systematic Sampling (follows pattern like every 10th item)
- Stratified Random Sampling (divide into characteristics like male or female)
- Cluster Sampling
