### Statistical Tests

* Infer Characteristics of the population from the sample.

* Measure the plausibility of a hypothesis

Best Practices

* Pick Hypothesis before looking at data
* Choose the null hypothesis on the basis of profitability
* Pick the alpha level first, taking into account both types of errors.
* Think about whether alpha=0.05 is appropriate for every test
* Report a p-Value to summarize the outcome of the test

#### Types of Tests

* Z-Test for proportions
* t-Test for testing the Mean

#### Null & Alternative Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis: specifies a default course of action, preserves status quo.

Alternative Hypothesis: Contradicts the assertion of the null hypothesis

#### Types of Errors

Type 1 Error:

* The mistake of taking action when no action is needed.
* Reject H0 incorrectly

Example: Buying software that is not cost-effective

Type 2 Error:

* The mistake of failing to take action when needed.
* Retain H0 incorrectly


* Example: Not buying software that would have been cost-effective.

#### P-Value

* Probability of an observed (or more extreme) result arising by chance
* The smallest Alpha-Level at which H0 can be rejected

#### Z-distribution

- Standard Normal distribution
- Mean = 0 | Standard Deviation = 1

#### Alpha-Level

* Level of significance
* Based on the probability of making a Type 1 Error

Commonly Used Values:

* High-Risk Decision: Alpha= 0.01
* Relative Certainty: Alpha = 0.05


* Low Risk: Alpha = 0.1
